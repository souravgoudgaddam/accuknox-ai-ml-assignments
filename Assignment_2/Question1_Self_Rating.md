## 1. Self-Assessment Ratings

**LLM – B (Can code under supervision):**  
Built LLM-based applications such as chatbots, resume parsers, and document question-answering systems using existing frameworks. Actively improving understanding of LLM behavior, prompting strategies, and internal workflows.

**Deep Learning – B (Can code under supervision):**  
Completed structured deep learning certifications from **DeepLearning.AI (Andrew Ng)** covering neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), sequence models (RNNs), and hyperparameter tuning. Applied these concepts through hands-on projects including MNIST digit classification, sentiment analysis, and pet image classification using MobileNet.

**Artificial Intelligence – B (Can code under supervision):**  
Applied AI concepts in real-world projects such as customer segmentation to identify patterns and support data-driven problem solving.

**Machine Learning – B (Can code under supervision):**  
Completed a Machine Learning Specialization and implemented both supervised and unsupervised learning models, including classification, regression, and customer segmentation.
