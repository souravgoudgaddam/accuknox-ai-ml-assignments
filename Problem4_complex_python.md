# Problem 4 – Most Complex Python Code

## Project: AI Resume Parser and Job Matching System

### Overview
This project is an end-to-end GenAI-powered resume parsing and job matching system built using Python. It processes unstructured resume PDFs, extracts structured information, and performs semantic matching between resumes and job descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs).

The system demonstrates advanced Python usage across document processing, embedding generation, vector storage, and LLM orchestration, all exposed through a clean API-based architecture.
